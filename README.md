# encoder-decoder
Python implementation of encoder decoder model with LSTM nodes for machine translation from english to french. 

Current main function setup to determine encoder/decoder weights for translation from one language to another (in my particular case source language = english to target language = french). The current main function will search the directory for dictionaries of words in the source and target languages (these are the files labele en.vec and fr.vec for english dictionary vectors and french dictionary vectors. Unfortunately, the size of the dictionaries is quite large and they did not fit on the repository. I will work to add these in the future. The code will not run until these files are added.
